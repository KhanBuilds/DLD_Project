# Face detecting laser
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Work_in_Progress-yellow)

This project uses Python's Opencv library to detect a face and, then through some math it calculates the X and Y cordinates of the face in degrees, and communicates it to arduino through the serial library, where it then uses the C++ code to moves the servos to the specific positon.
